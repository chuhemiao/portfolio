## Executive Summary

OSL Group (HKEX: 863.HK) has established itself as Asia's premier regulated digital asset infrastructure provider, bridging traditional finance and crypto through a compliance-first architecture. The company demonstrates strong financial performance with HKD 195M revenue in 1H 2025 (58% YoY growth) and HKD 68.2B transaction volume (200% YoY growth). Their recent acquisition of Banxa solidifies a global footprint across 40+ regulated jurisdictions, while their institutional-grade custody with USD 1B insurance coverage sets a new industry standard.

The core investment thesis centers on OSL's structural positioning at the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. Unlike offshore exchanges or retail-focused platforms, OSL has built defensible moats through: (1) Regulatory licensing supremacy (SFC Hong Kong + 40+ global licenses), (2) Institutional infrastructure (Omnibus Pro, MirrorEX, SOC 2 Type 2 certification), and (3) Recurring revenue diversification (29% from OSL Pay infrastructure services).

For tier-1 institutions, OSL represents the lowest-risk entry point into Asian digital asset markets with proven compliance architecture and banking integration capabilities. The model prioritizes regulatory certainty over speculative volume, making it ideally suited for banks, asset managers, and enterprises seeking compliant crypto exposure.

## 1. Project Overview

Stage Assessment: Established Regulated Operator
OSL operates at the mature end of the crypto infrastructure spectrum, having secured:

- Institutional client base including banks, brokers, and asset managers

## 2. System Architecture and Infrastructure Design

Investment Verdict: STRONG PARTNER/CUSTOMER RECOMMENDATION

For tier-1 financial institutions and crypto-native funds, OSL represents the optimal partner for regulated digital asset infrastructure in Asia and increasingly globally. The combination of:

- Unmatched regulatory positioning with 40+ jurisdictional licenses
- Institutional-grade security with USD 1B insurance coverage
- Proven revenue growth and business model diversification
- Strategic acquisition strategy enhancing global capabilities

makes OSL the lowest-risk, highest-compliance option for institutions seeking crypto exposure. While fees may be higher than offshore alternatives and innovation pace may be slower due to regulatory requirements, these are appropriate trade-offs for institutional participants prioritizing capital protection and regulatory compliance.

The Banxa acquisition fundamentally transforms OSL's positioning from a Hong Kong-focused exchange to a global digital asset infrastructure provider, creating significant strategic optionality for future growth across both developed and emerging markets.

Recommended Action: Tier-1 institutions should prioritize OSL for:

1. Custody relationships for Asian digital asset holdings
2. Execution services for compliant trading
3. Infrastructure partnerships for white-label solutions
4. Strategic investments given public market accessibility and growth trajectory
