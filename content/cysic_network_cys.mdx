## Executive Summary

Cysic Network represents a vertically integrated approach to decentralized verifiable compute, combining custom hardware acceleration with blockchain coordination to address the structural problems of ZK proof centralization and AI compute trust deficits. The protocol has transitioned to early mainnet (December 2025) with demonstrated technical capability (7M+ proofs generated) and substantial community interest (23,000+ verifier applications). At current valuation ($64.3M market cap, $400M FDV), Cysic sits at an inflection point where execution risk remains high but differentiation is clear through hardware integration.

Key Investment Thesis: Cysic's value proposition hinges on becoming the default verifiable compute layer for ZK rollups and AI protocols by solving the trilemma of decentralization, performance, and cost through specialized hardware and cryptographic verification. Success requires overcoming capital-intensive hardware deployment, proving economic sustainability beyond subsidized emissions, and capturing demand from both crypto-native and traditional compute markets.

## 1. Project Overview

Cysic Network operates in the verifiable compute infrastructure sector, specifically targeting ZK proof generation and decentralized AI compute markets. The protocol functions as a full-stack decentralized compute infrastructure that transforms computational resources into verifiable, tokenized assets. [Cysic Documentation](https://docs.cysic.xyz/)

Core Architecture: Built on Cosmos CDK as a layer-1 blockchain using CometBFT BFT consensus, Cysic implements a novel Proof-of-Compute mechanism that incorporates both staked tokens and pledged computation into consensus. The system is structured as a modular stack with four layers: Hardware, Consensus, Execution, and Product layers. [Cysic Documentation](https://docs.cysic.xyz/)

Development Stage: Cysic has progressed through multiple testnet phases (Phase I launched July 2024, Phase II in progress) and transitioned to early mainnet in December 2025. Evidence includes active trading on major exchanges (Binance Alpha, Gate.io, Bitget), mainnet blockchain explorer functionality, and ongoing node operator recruitment.

## 2. System Architecture and Threat Model

### Core Actors and Responsibilities

| Actor             | Role                                                         | Incentives                                | Requirements                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compute Providers | Contribute computational power for proof generation          | Earn CYS tokens for completed tasks       | Professional hardware: 64GB RAM, 16GB VRAM GPU, 100GB storage |
| Task Requesters   | Submit ZK proof or AI computation workloads                  | Pay for decentralized, verifiable compute | Deposit tokens into task smart contracts                      |
| Verifiers         | Validate proof correctness through light client verification | Earn rewards for verification work        | Standard consumer-grade hardware                              |
| Agents            | Relay tasks between external projects and Cysic Network      | Service fees or protocol rewards          | Initially operated by Cysic, transitioning to permissionless  |

### Architectural Components

The system employs a multi-layered approach:

- Hardware Layer: Physical infrastructure including GPU servers, ASIC miners, and custom ZK acceleration hardware
- Consensus Layer: Proof-of-Compute mechanism building on CometBFT BFT consensus
- Execution Layer: Smart contracts for job scheduling, workload routing, and bridging
- Product Layer: Domain-specific modules for ZK proving, AI inference, and mining workloads [Cysic Documentation](https://docs.cysic.xyz/)

### Threat Model and Mitigations

Primary Threats:

1. Malicious Provers: Submitting invalid proofs to sabotage network or steal rewards
   - _Mitigation_: Cryptographic proof verification + redundancy (multiple provers per task) + staking slashing
2. Sybil Attacks: Creating multiple identities to game task allocation
   - _Mitigation_: Verifiable Random Function selection weighted by ve-token holdings
3. Collusion Attacks: Provers and verifiers coordinating to approve invalid proofs
   - _Mitigation_: Large validator committees (VCMs) with distributed voting + AVS services
4. Economic Attacks: Manipulating reward mechanisms or token economics
   - _Mitigation_: Time-locked vesting for team/investors, gradual DAO transition [Cysic Whitepaper](https://hackmd.io/@Cysic/H1XlGr0jle)

The system explicitly assumes Byzantine conditions (up to 1/3 malicious nodes) and implements cryptographic verification, economic staking, and redundancy to maintain security.

## 3. Verifiable Compute and ZK Proof Infrastructure

### Technical Implementation

Cysic supports multiple proof systems including Halo2, Plonky2, Gnark, and RapidSnark through both GPU acceleration and custom ASIC designs. The workflow follows a structured pipeline:

1. Task Submission: ZK projects deposit tokens and notify agent contracts
2. Prover Selection: Interested provers run VRF to determine eligibility (probability weighted by ve-tokens)
3. Proof Generation: Fastest three provers complete computation and update blockchain status
4. Verification: Larger validator committee verifies proofs through light client validation
5. Settlement: Valid proofs trigger reward distribution; invalid proofs trigger slashing [Cysic ZK Layer](https://docs.cysic.xyz/readme/zk-proof-layer)

### Performance Characteristics

The protocol addresses two fundamental ZK challenges:

- Prover Decentralization: Avoids single points of failure while maintaining efficiency through hardware acceleration
- Verification Cost/Latency: Uses two-stage settlement (off-chain verification + aggregated on-chain settlement) to balance cost and latency

Comparative Advantage: Unlike centralized prover services (e.g., traditional cloud providers), Cysic offers decentralized verification. Unlike rollup-native markets, Cysic provides hardware acceleration and cross-protocol support. The custom ASIC development (ZK C1 chip) promises 10-100× efficiency gains over GPU-based alternatives.

## 4. Hardware Coordination and Decentralized Compute Economy

### Hardware Integration Strategy

Cysic employs a vertically integrated hardware stack:

| Product    | Target Market          | Capabilities                          | Status        |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| ZK C1 Chip | Embedded systems       | Modular arithmetic, FFTs, MSMs        | Expected 2026 |
| ZK-Air     | Developers/Researchers | Plug-and-play accelerator, USB-C/PCIe | Expected 2026 |
| ZK-Pro     | Enterprise users       | Multi-chip clusters, high throughput  | Expected 2026 |

Minimum Requirements for Node Operators:

- GPU Nodes: 64GB RAM, 16GB VRAM, 100GB storage, 8-core CPU
- Consumer Verification: Standard hardware sufficient for light client duties [Prover Guide](https://docs.cysic.xyz/tutorial-docs/how-to-run-a-prover-node)

### Economic Coordination

Compute resources are treated as yield-generating infrastructure assets rather than pure commodities. The coordination mechanism involves:

1. Task Matching: Marketplace matches workloads with providers based on performance, fairness, and reliability
2. Bidding System: Providers bid on tasks with adjustable pricing to maximize earnings
3. Performance-Based Rewards: Higher stake and better performance translate to improved task priority and earnings
4. Resource Normalization: Heterogeneous resources (GPU cycles, ASIC hashes, proof cycles) are normalized for comparable pricing

This approach creates capital efficiency through:

- Utilization-based rewards rather than pure staking yields
- Hardware flexibility (from consumer devices to data center systems)
- Dynamic pricing based on supply-demand dynamics

## 5. Protocol Economics and Token Design

### CYS Token Utility

The CYS token (1 billion total supply) serves three primary functions:

1. Compute Access: Providers must reserve CYS to run provers, AI nodes, or computing tasks
2. Governance Rights: Staking CYS mints CGT (Cysic Governance Token) for voting on upgrades, parameters, and validator election
3. Reward Distribution: Compute providers earn CYS for supplying hardware; stakers earn for securing consensus

### Token Allocation and Emission

| Category              | Allocation | Vesting Schedule               | Notes                                       |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Community & Ecosystem | 40.19%     | Dynamic distribution           | Grants, bounties, mining/staking incentives |
| Investors             | 23.62%     | 1-year cliff + 12-month linear | Not stakeable while locked                  |
| Contributors          | 12.11%     | 1-year cliff + 36-month linear | Not stakeable while locked                  |
| Foundation Treasury   | 8%         | 1-year cliff + 24-month linear | DAO-controlled post-launch                  |
| Community Incentives  | 16.08%     | Immediate                      | Testnet rewards, NFT campaigns, liquidity   |

Economic Sustainability: Protocol revenue is directly tied to real compute demand through task fees rather than inflationary subsidies. However, the model remains sensitive to competition from both centralized cloud providers and alternative ZK networks on cost and performance metrics.

## 6. Governance, Security, and Upgradeability

### Governance Structure

Cysic implements a dual-token governance model:

- CYS: The base token used for staking and compute access
- CGT: Governance token minted through staking CYS, used for voting rights

Governance Controls:

- Protocol upgrades and economic parameters
- Block producer and validator node election
- Community fund management and grant proposals
- Treasury control (transitioning to DAO over time)

### Security Considerations

Smart Contract Risk: As a Cosmos-based chain, Cysic inherits the security model of Cosmos SDK and CometBFT. The execution layer utilizes EVM-compatible smart contracts for coordination.

Cryptographic Risk: The protocol relies on established cryptographic primitives but implements custom hardware acceleration. The ZK C1 ASIC design introduces potential side-channel vulnerabilities that require rigorous security auditing.

Hardware Trust Assumptions: The vertical integration model creates dependence on Cysic's hardware security. Unlike pure software solutions, hardware vulnerabilities could require physical recalls or updates.

Failure Modes: Under adversarial conditions, the network could experience:

- Task starvation if malicious actors dominate prover selection
- Verification delays if validator committees are compromised
- Economic instability if token volatility affects staking economics
