## Executive Summary

USD.AI represents a specialized credit protocol targeting AI infrastructure financing through a hybrid RWA-backed model. With $561.5M TVL and a $1.2B loan pipeline (including a $500M facility for Sharon AI), the protocol demonstrates early traction in a niche market. The economic model generates value through net interest spreads (6.57% base case) between GPU-backed loan yields (targeting 15-25%) and sUSDai holder returns (10.43% current APR).

Value accrual is medium-strength, concentrated in sUSDai holders rather than a governance token, with structural advantages in AI credit underwriting offset by subscale TVL versus competitors. The upcoming CHIP token launch at $300M FDV appears fully valued relative to enterprise value projections, requiring a 30% liquidity discount due to extreme holder concentration.

Key risks include high borrower concentration (96% top 2 holders), untested default cycles in AI hardware lending, and regulatory uncertainty around synthetic yield instruments. The base case fair value range of $210-302M suggests limited upside from current implied valuations.

| Metric                | Value     | Assessment                              |
| --------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Investment Conviction | Medium    | Niche potential vs. execution risk      |
| Suggested Allocation  | 0.5-1.5%  | Satellite position for yield strategies |
| Upside/Downside       | +15%/-40% | Asymmetric risk to downside             |

## Economic Classification & Valuation Framework

USD.AI is classified as a Hybrid RWA-backed Credit Protocol and Yield-bearing Synthetic Dollar with the following characteristics:

- Credit issuance protocol - Originates loans against tokenized GPU collateral
- Balance-sheet intermediary - Maintains asset-liability matching between loan book and stablecoin liabilities
- Yield-bearing synthetic dollar - sUSDai provides structured yield exposure to AI infrastructure debt

Valuation Framework Selection: Spread-Based Balance Sheet Model
This approach is appropriate because USD.AI generates value through net interest margin rather than transaction fees or monetary premium. The model captures:

- Asset yield from GPU-backed loans (15-25% target)
- Funding cost via sUSDai yields (10.43% current)
- Credit losses (2% base case assumption)
- Administrative expenses (1% assumption)

The enterprise value approximates the present value of future net interest spreads, reflecting the protocol's economic essence as a credit intermediary rather than a pure stablecoin or governance platform.

## Protocol Overview & Fact Base

### Core Mechanics

USD.AI operates a dual-token model: USDai (fully-backed stablecoin for redemptions) and sUSDai (yield-bearing token backed by income-generating assets). The protocol functions as an onchain bank for AI companies, providing loans collateralized by tokenized GPU assets with the following mechanics:

- Peg Maintenance: USDai maintains its peg through instant redeemability against underlying assets (T-bills and loan collateral) at all times
- Yield Generation: sUSDai yield derives from interest payments on GPU-backed loans to AI infrastructure providers, with idle capital earning Treasury bill yields
- Collateral Model: Loans are over-collateralized with verified GPU assets that are tokenized onchain through the CALIBER system

### Scale and Usage Metrics

| Metric             | Value             | Date       | Source                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| TVL                | $561.5M           | 2026-02-12 | Protocol Website       |
| sUSDai Supply      | ~309.9M tokens    | 2026-02-12 | On-chain Analysis      |
| Current sUSDai APR | 10.43%            | 2026-02-12 | Protocol Website       |
| Target Loan APR    | 15-25%            | N/A        | Protocol Documentation |
| Loan Pipeline      | $1.2B+            | 2026-01-22 | Public Announcements   |
| Largest Facility   | $500M (Sharon AI) | 2026-01-22 | The Block              |

_Data Limitation: Detailed loan book composition, average loan duration, and default history are not publicly available, requiring conservative assumptions in credit modeling._

### Revenue Model Decomposition

| Revenue Source    | % of Total  | Recurring | Risk Level  | Sustainable?             |
| ----------------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| GPU Loan Interest | ~80% (est.) | Yes       | Medium-High | Conditional on AI demand |
| Treasury Yield    | ~20% (est.) | Yes       | Low         | Yes                      |
| Protocol Fees     | Minimal     | Yes       | Low         | Yes                      |

Revenue Quality Assessment: Yield appears organic from real borrowers rather than incentive-driven, but sustainability depends on continued AI infrastructure investment cycle and underwriting quality. The 10.43% current yield significantly exceeds traditional stablecoin yields, suggesting compensation for illiquidity and credit risk.

### Tokenomics and Supply Structure

CHIP Governance Token:

- Total supply: 10B tokens
- ICO price: $0.03 per token (FDV $300M)
- Sale date: February 22-27, 2026 (CoinList)
- Initial circulation: 700M tokens (7% of supply)
- Unlock schedule: 100% at TGE (March 2026)

Token Dynamics:

- USDai: Non-inflationary, fully backed stablecoin
- sUSDai: Non-rebasing yield accumulator
- Critical Risk: Extreme holder concentration - top address controls 68.4% of supply, top 2 control 96.3%

## Structural Analysis

### Value Accrual Analysis

Value Flow Mapping:

```
Borrowers → Loan Interest (15-25%) → Protocol Spread (6.57% net) → sUSDai Holders
```

- USDai: Captures minimal value (utility stablecoin)
- sUSDai: Strong value accrual - direct claim on net interest income
- CHIP token: Weak value accrual - governance only, no fee sharing or buybacks

The structural demand driver is AI infrastructure financing growth, but value capture is limited to sUSDai holders without mechanism for governance token value accrual.

### Balance Sheet Risk Assessment

Estimated Balance Sheet Structure:

- Assets: $561.5M (~80% GPU loans, ~20% T-bills)
- Liabilities: $561.5M (USDai + sUSDai claims)

Key Risk Ratios:

- Collateral Ratio: >100% (over-collateralized loans)
- Loan-to-Value: Estimated 60-70% (conservative)
- Default Rate Assumption: 2% base case
- Liquidity Coverage: Adequate for redemptions (T-bill allocation)

Stress Test Scenario: A 20% default rate on the loan book would impair ~$90M of assets, potentially threatening sUSDai yields and redemption capacity. The protocol's novelty means default cycles are untested.

### Competitive Landscape

| Protocol     | TVL      | Yield    | Collateral Type    | Risk Model          | Transparency |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ |
| USD.AI       | $561M    | 10.43%   | GPU + T-bills      | Over-collateralized | Medium       |
| Ondo Finance | $2.4B    | ~5%      | Treasuries + Bonds | Institutional       | High         |
| Ethena       | $6.5B    | Variable | Delta-neutral      | Synthetic           | Medium       |
| MakerDAO     | ~$5B RWA | ~5%      | Diversified RWA    | Mixed               | High         |

Moat Assessment: Score 6/10

- Strengths: Specialized AI credit expertise, first-mover in GPU financing, structural yield advantage
- Weaknesses: Subscale vs. competitors, untested credit cycles, regulatory uncertainty
- Moat Drivers: AI underwriting expertise, proprietary collateral tokenization (CALIBER), institutional partnerships

Valuation Outcomes:

<chart item_id='create_chart_usd_ai_ev_scenarios_20260212105717'></chart>

### Discount Rate Justification

The 14% base discount rate comprises:

- Risk-free rate: 4% (long-term Treasury yield)
- Credit risk premium: 5% (untested loan book)
- Protocol risk premium: 3% (smart contract/regulatory risk)
- Illiquidity premium: 2% (novel asset class)

### Sensitivity Analysis

Valuation Sensitivity Matrix ($M):

| Default Rate ↓ | Discount Rate → | 10%   | 15%   | 20% |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----- | ----- | --- |
| 1%             | 394.8           | 337.1 | 290.7 |
| 3%             | 290.5           | 248.0 | 213.9 |
| 5%             | 186.2           | 159.0 | 137.1 |

The matrix demonstrates significant vulnerability to credit losses, with a 5% default rate reducing valuation by 54% from base case.

### Liquidity Adjustment

The CHIP token's $300M FDV requires a 30% liquidity discount due to:

Catalyst Timeline:

- Feb 22-27, 2026: CHIP token sale on CoinList
- Q1 2026: Sharon AI $65M initial drawdown
- March 2026: CHIP TGE and full unlock
- Quarterly: Loan book performance reporting

## Conclusion

USD.AI presents a compelling niche opportunity in AI infrastructure financing with structural yield advantages but material risks. The protocol's innovative approach to GPU-backed lending addresses a genuine market need, evidenced by the $1.2B+ loan pipeline. However, the combination of untested credit cycles, extreme holder concentration, and regulatory uncertainty warrants caution.

From a valuation perspective, the base case enterprise value of $210-302M suggests the CHIP token's $300M FDV is fully priced, requiring a 30% liquidity discount to reach fair value. Investors should consider sUSDai for yield exposure rather than CHIP for governance, given the weak value accrual mechanisms for the governance token.

Recommended action: Establish a small position in sUSDai for yield generation (1-2% portfolio allocation) while monitoring credit performance through 2026. Avoid CHIP token until proven governance utility and better token distribution emerge.
