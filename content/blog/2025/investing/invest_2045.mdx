## 01 | Mega Trends: Productivity Leaps Determine Asset Evolution

Three main threads will shape the global productivity landscape over the next 20 years:

1. AI & Computing Power Revolution — A paradigm shift similar to the Industrial Revolution and Internet Revolution, continuously reshaping corporate profit models and national competitiveness.
2. Demographics & Aging — East Asia, Europe, and the US all face "low growth + high burden," creating demand for stable cash flow assets.
3. Monetary & Institutional Fragmentation — The USD remains hegemonic, but de-dollarization, crypto-native finance, and digital assets will become part of the new order.

Conclusion: Quality assets of the future will inevitably be embedded in these three threads.

## 02 | Four Dimensions of Certainty Assets

1. Cash Flow Certainty: Capable of sustained dividends/buybacks, or having stable user payment habits.
2. Rule Certainty: Clear property rights, institutional support, capable of long-term operation.
3. Productivity Embeddedness: Irreplaceable social infrastructure (such as computing power, electricity, payment).
4. Long-term Growth: Ability to expand long-term with GDP or industry dividends.

## 03 | US Stocks: AI + Platform Leaders Remain the Core

US quality assets have proven two principles over the past 70 years:

- Index Self-Evolution → Long-term holding of S&P/Nasdaq is essentially "betting on American productivity."
- Leader Long-termism → FAANG, with continuously strengthening cash flow and moats.

Directions worth holding long-term for the next 20 years:

- Computing Chain Leaders: NVIDIA (GPU), TSMC (manufacturing), ASML (lithography), Broadcom (communication chips).
- AI Platforms: Microsoft (cloud+Copilot), Gemini, Claude, OpenAI ecosystem-related public companies.
- Cloud + Software Subscription Model: Amazon, Figma, PLTR, NET.

> Allocation Logic: US stocks portion = broad-based indices (S&P500/Nasdaq) + AI/computing chain leaders.

## 04 | Japanese Stocks: Structural Opportunities & "Post-Lost Decades Recovery"

Japan's 30-year stagnation kept asset valuations low, but recovery signals have emerged since the 2020s:

- Japanese companies hold massive overseas cash assets, and dividend/buyback culture is forming.
- The yen has been undervalued long-term, benefiting export industries and overseas earnings.
- Structural industry advantages: materials, semiconductor equipment, robotics, automotive electrification.

Quality directions for the next 20 years:

- Robotics & Automation: FANUC, Yaskawa Electric.
- Semiconductor Equipment: Tokyo Electron, SCREEN.
- Automotive Electrification & Battery Chain: Toyota, Panasonic.
- High Dividend ETFs (such as JPX-Nikkei 400, TSE dividend-type ETFs).

## 05 | Web3: Native Finance & Crypto Certainty Assets

Web3 is a "new asset class" emerging from institutional and monetary fragmentation, with certainty derived from code and network effects.

Quality assets are divided into three layers:

1. Currency & Settlement Layer

   - BTC (immutable monetary rules, global value anchor)
   - ETH (smart contract settlement layer, block space fee revenue)

2. Infrastructure Layer

   - Oracles (Chainlink)
   - Decentralized Storage (Arweave, Filecoin)
   - Cross-chain Communication (LayerZero, Wormhole)

3. Cash Flow Protocols

   - Market Makers & Stablecoins (Uniswap, Aave, MakerDAO, Circle), REV models with stable revenue
   - DEX/CEX, Binance, OKX, Coinbase, Hyperliquid, etc.

> Allocation Logic: Web3 is a satellite asset in the portfolio, using small capital to capture high growth while focusing on protocols that continuously generate cash flow.

---

## 06 | Gold & Supranational Assets

Gold's certainty comes from central bank accumulation + de-dollarization; it remains a global "value anchor."
Bitcoin is digital gold, gradually gaining sovereign institutional recognition, with US equities accelerating the entire market through the DAT model.

Allocation approach:

- Gold ETF / Physical = 5–10%
- BTC / ETH = 2–5%

---

## 07 | Allocation Framework: Core—Satellite—Opportunity

### Standard Allocation (suitable for A7+ long-term holders; if you're a speculator, core and satellite assets can be swapped)

- Core Assets 65%

  - US Stocks: S&P/Nasdaq broad-based + AI/computing leaders
  - Japanese Stocks: High dividend ETFs + semiconductor/robotics leaders

- Satellite Assets 25%

  - Web3: BTC/ETH + cash flow protocols
  - Gold/Commodities: Hedge against currency and inflation

- Opportunity Assets 10%

  - Early-stage VC Web3/AI projects
  - Trend trading (CTA, macro hedging)

---

## 08 | Execution & Discipline

1. Dollar-cost averaging into indices, concentrate on leaders: Don't try to bottom-pick, trade time for space.
2. Rebalancing: Trigger at ±10% bandwidth (e.g., if BTC rises to 15% of portfolio, automatically reduce position).
3. Cash Flow Anchoring: Ensure cash flow ≈ 30% of portfolio value every 5–6 years to avoid being washed out in bear markets.
4. Cathie Wood Strategy: Cast wide net early, hold leaders mid-term, hold only top leaders late-stage.

---

## 09 | Conclusion

Quality assets for the next 20 years are not about finding a perfect answer, but about navigating major transitions with:

- Core: US AI & computing chain, Japanese recovery industries.
- Satellite: Web3 certainty protocols, gold and digital gold.
- Opportunity: Trending new sectors.

> The ultimate goal of investing is not to predict market movements, but to let certainty assets and compound interest work for you.

Tips - What is "Core—Satellite—Opportunity"?

A classic asset allocation framework (Core–Satellite Strategy):

Core: Long-term stable assets that bear primary returns and risk control, such as S&P 500, Nasdaq, Japanese high-dividend ETFs, Bitcoin, ETH, gold. Characteristics: "strong certainty, low volatility, long-term holdable."

Satellite: Growth assets that are unstable, used to enhance portfolio excess returns, such as Web3, crypto assets, innovative tech stocks, etc. Characteristics: "high growth, high risk, asymmetric returns."

Opportunity: High-risk, high-reward speculative or short-term opportunity investments, such as early-stage startup projects, hot sector themes (AI Agents, quantum computing, NFT boom, etc.). Characteristics: "high odds, low position, strategic participation."

Satellites are like moons orbiting Earth (core), cannot replace the core but can add extra light and momentum to the portfolio.

Tips - Cathie Wood Strategy:

- Early stage like VC: Compete on coverage and luck.
- Mid-stage like growth investor: Compete on insight and strategic judgment.
- Late-stage like value investor: Compete on certainty and stable cash flow.
