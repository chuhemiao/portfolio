When you click the "buy" button on an exchange and your order is executed within milliseconds, you may never have thought about who is taking your order on the other end. When the market crashes and everyone is selling, why are there always people willing to buy? This "invisible opponent" is the market maker—the most mysterious, powerful, and easily misunderstood role in the crypto market.

Market makers are not philanthropists, nor are they market "stabilizers." They are sophisticated profit-making machines, capturing small but certain gains with every price fluctuation. They are both providers of liquidity and designers of the market's microstructure; they maintain smooth trading while also manipulating price movements at times. Understanding market makers means understanding the underlying logic of how the crypto market operates.

## I. The essence of market makers: creators of liquidity and price setters of risk

### Liquidity is not generated naturally, but rather "manufactured"

In a market without market makers, buyers and sellers must wait for each other to appear. If you want to sell 1 BTC at 72,000 USDT, you need to wait for someone willing to buy at that price. This wait could be seconds or hours—this is the liquidity trap.

Market makers broke this deadlock. They simultaneously place orders on both sides of the order book: a buy order at 72,199 USDT and a sell order at 72,293 USDT. Whether you want to buy or sell, the transaction is executed instantly. This "instantaneity" doesn't come free—the 94 USDT spread is the cost you pay for "no waiting," and it's also the market maker's core revenue.

### The triple identity of market makers

Liquidity Provider They continuously place orders on their order books to ensure there is always a counterparty available. Platforms like OctoBot quantify this capability through a "Liquidity Score"—ranging from 0 to 10, with 10 representing excellent liquidity and ease of trading.

Risk Taker For every transaction, a market maker maintains inventory. If they buy 1 BTC at 72,199 USDT, but the market suddenly drops to 70,000 USDT, they will lose 2,199 USDT. This "inventory risk" is the market maker's biggest enemy and the fundamental reason they charge spreads—spreads are essentially compensation for bearing immediate and inventory risks.

Price Discoverer Market makers eliminate price discrepancies by arbitrage between different exchanges, thus bringing global market prices closer together. Their pricing strategies directly influence the market's perception of an asset's "fair value."

## II. The Operating Mechanism of Market Makers: A Precision Game on the Order Book

### Anatomy of the Order Book

To understand market makers, you must first understand the structure of the order book. Let's take the BTC/USDT order book shown by OctoBot as an example:

Ask side :

- 72,669 USDT: 0.138 BTC (Total value 10,052 USDT)

- 72,575 USDT: 0.104 BTC (Total value 7,529 USDT)

- 72,481 USDT: 0.069 BTC (Total value 5,013 USDT)

- 72,387 USDT: 0.035 BTC (Total value 2,503 USDT)

Bids side :

- 72,199 USDT: 0.035 BTC (Total value 2,497 USDT)

- 72,105 USDT: 0.069 BTC (Total value 4,987 USDT)

- 72,011 USDT: 0.104 BTC (Total value 7,471 USDT)

- 71,917 USDT: 0.138 BTC (Total value 9,948 USDT)

Current market price 72,293 USDT

This order book reveals several key pieces of information:

1. Price spread The difference between the best selling price (72,387 USDT) and the best buying price (72,199 USDT) is 188 USDT, which is approximately 0.26% of the price. This is the market maker's "margin of safety".

2. Depth Order volume at each price level. Note that the closer to the market price, the smaller the order volume (0.035 BTC), and the further away from the market price, the larger the order volume (0.138 BTC). This is the market maker's risk management strategy—exposing the least amount of inventory at the price most likely to be filled.

3. Symmetry The order volumes on both the buy and sell sides are almost perfectly symmetrical. This is not a coincidence, but rather the result of deliberate design by market makers—they want the probabilities of buying and selling to be equal, thereby maintaining inventory neutrality.

### Three core strategies of algorithmic trading

Modern market makers no longer rely on manual order placement, but instead use highly sophisticated algorithms. Based on academic research and industry practice, mainstream strategies include:

1. Avellaneda-Stoikov model: Dynamic spread adjustment

This is the most classic mathematical model for market makers. The core idea is that the spread should be dynamically adjusted based on market volatility and inventory deviation.

- When market volatility intensifies, the spread is automatically widened to compensate for risk.

- When there is too much inventory (too much BTC), lower the selling price and raise the buying price to accelerate the selling.

- When inventory is insufficient, reverse the operation.

The "Automated Rebalancing" feature of the OctoBot platform is a practical application of this model.

1. Order Book Microstructure Modeling: Markov Chain Prediction

Advanced market makers analyze order book patterns in real time to predict market behavior in the next second:

- A sudden appearance of a large buy order may indicate upward pressure on prices, prompting investors to raise their selling price in advance.

- Order book depth suddenly decreases → Large market orders may be imminent → Temporarily cancel orders to mitigate risk.

- Historical data shows that volatility increases over a certain period → Proactively widen price spreads.

This strategy requires massive amounts of historical data and machine learning models, and is the core competitiveness of top market makers (such as Jump Trading and Wintertermute).

1. Cross-exchange arbitrage: Global liquidity optimization

Professional market makers do not operate on just one exchange. They will:

- Orders are placed simultaneously on 15+ exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.

- Real-time monitoring of price differences across exchanges

- When the price of BTC on Binance is 50 USDT higher than on Coinbase, sell on Binance and buy on Coinbase to lock in a risk-free profit.

This strategy, known as "statistical arbitrage," is a significant source of revenue for market makers. OctoBot's "Multi-Exchange Integration" feature is designed specifically for this purpose.

## III. The Profit Model of Market Makers: It's Not Just About Price Spreads

### Multidimensional matrix of income sources

1. Bid-Ask Spread: Basic Income

This is the most straightforward way to profit. Assuming a market maker completes 1,000 two-way trades (1,000 buy orders and 1,000 sell orders) in a day, earning a 0.26% spread on each trade, the total revenue would be:

- Single transaction size: 10,000 USDT

- Profit from a single price difference: 10,000 × 0.26% = 26 USDT

- Daily income: 26 × 1,000 = 26,000 USDT

But this is only an ideal scenario. In reality, market makers face three major challenges:

- Adverse selection When the market is about to experience significant volatility, informed traders will rush to execute trades, forcing market makers to hold inventory at unfavorable prices.

- Inventory Risk In a one-sided market trend, market makers may buy or sell in large quantities, making it impossible for them to remain neutral.

- Competition Other market makers are narrowing price spreads to grab orders and squeeze profit margins.

1. Exchange Rebates: Hidden Cash Flow

To attract market makers, most exchanges offer "maker fee waivers" or even "negative rates" (the exchange pays them to participate). For example:

- Regular traders: Pay a 0.1% commission.

- Market maker: Receives a 0.02% rebate.

This means that even with a zero spread, market makers can earn a net profit of 0.04% for each completed two-way trade. For top market makers with daily trading volumes of hundreds of millions of dollars, this rebate can account for 30-50% of their total revenue.

1. Project service fees: The real goldmine of B2B business

When a new coin is launched, the project team's biggest concern is the "liquidity death spiral"—no liquidity → no one trading → even less liquidity. Market makers provide not only technical services, but also confidence and endorsement.

OctoBot's pricing model reveals the size of this market:

- Starter Package $299.99/month, supports 1 trading pair

- Standard Package $499.99/month, supports 3 trading pairs

- Enterprise Package Customizable pricing, supports multiple trading pairs

However, this is just the pricing for smaller market makers. Top-tier market makers (such as GSR, Cumberland, and Wintertermute) might charge the following service fees:

- Initial costs: $50,000 - $200,000

- Monthly service fee: $20,000 - $100,000

- Token lock-up requirement: 5-15% of the total project supply.

For a medium-sized project, the annual market-making service fee could be as high as $500,000 to $1 million.

1. Monetizing Information Advantage: The Least Transparent Source of Profit

Market makers possess an informational advantage that ordinary traders cannot obtain because they continuously monitor the order book.

- Order flow insights Anticipating the pressure of large-scale transactions

- Market sentiment indicators Judging the degree of market fear or greed by changes in order book depth

- Price forecasting ability Predicting short-term price trends based on microstructure data

This information can be used for:

- Proprietary trading: making directional bets using one's own funds.

- Adjust your pricing strategy in advance: Cancel orders or widen spreads before significant market fluctuations.

- Selling data to hedge funds: Packaging order flow data into "market microstructure signals" for sale.

This portion of revenue is extremely difficult to quantify, but it may account for 20-40% of the total profits of top market makers.

## IV. The Dark Side of Market Makers: Manipulation, Fraud, and Regulatory Vacuum

### False liquidity: an order book that appears deep

Not all pending orders are genuine. Some unethical market makers use the "ghost orders" strategy:

- To create the illusion of "ample liquidity," place numerous buy and sell orders on the order book.

- When a real trader attempts to execute a trade, the order is instantly cancelled.

- Actual orders only account for 10-30% of the total pending orders.

This behavior is known as "spoofing" in traditional financial markets and is clearly illegal. However, in the crypto market, due to a lack of regulation, this manipulation is extremely common.

### Cooperating with project owners to "manipulate" the market: from market making to market manipulation

Some market makers collude with project developers to manipulate prices:

Pump phase :

- The funds provided by the market maker commercial project team were used to purchase large quantities of [goods/products].

- Creating the illusion of "strong buying" to attract retail investors to follow suit.

- The price rose from 1 USDT to 5 USDT.

Dump stage :

- Market makers gradually sell at high prices, transferring their holdings to retail investors.

- At the same time, remove the buy support orders and let the price freefall.

- The price plummeted from 5 USDT to 0.5 USDT.

This "pump and dump" model is extremely common in small-cap tokens. Market makers don't profit from the price difference, but rather from the principal of retail investors.

### Front-Running: Harvesting profits by leveraging information advantage

Market makers, because they can see the order flow, may engage in front-running transactions:

- A large purchase order of $1 million has been detected and is about to be placed.

- Early buying drives up prices

- After a large buy order is executed, sell immediately to make a profit.

In decentralized exchanges (DEXs), this behavior is known as “MEV” (Maximal Extractable Value) and has formed a multi-billion dollar gray industry.

## V. The Future of Market Makers: A Paradigm Shift from Centralization to Decentralization

### The Dilemma of Traditional Market Makers

Market makers on centralized exchanges (CEXs) are facing three major challenges:

Regulatory pressure New regulations such as MiCA (European Crypto Asset Market Regulation) require market makers to operate with licenses, leading to a sharp increase in compliance costs. Market makers like Orcabay, which have obtained MiCA regulatory licenses, will gain a competitive advantage.

Competition is fierce Top market makers (Jump Crypto, DWF Labs, GSR) hold more than 60% of the market share, squeezing the survival space of small and medium-sized market makers.

Technology Arms Race Reducing latency from milliseconds to microseconds requires an investment of millions of dollars in building dedicated networks and hardware.

### A New Paradigm for DeFi Market Making: From Professionalism to Democratization

The Automated Market Maker (AMM) model in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) has revolutionized the game:

The revolution of Uniswap V3 :

- Anyone can become a liquidity provider (LP).

- Through "concentrated liquidity" technology, LPs can provide liquidity within a specified price range.

- Capital efficiency is 4000 times higher than traditional AMM.

However, DeFi market making also has a fatal flaw:

Impermanent Loss When prices fluctuate, LPs' returns will be lower than simply holding the asset. In highly volatile markets, impermanent loss can wipe out all fee income.

Smart contract risks Code vulnerabilities can lead to the theft of funds. Between 2021 and 2025, DeFi protocols lost more than $3 billion due to vulnerabilities.

### The Rise of Hybrid Models: The Fusion of CEX and DEX

Future market makers will operate on both CEXs and DEXs, forming a "full-domain liquidity network":

- Offer deep liquidity on CEXs to earn spreads and rebates.

- Deploy LP strategies on DEXs to earn transaction fees and token incentives.

- Arbitrage between different chains and protocols through cross-chain bridges and aggregators

Top institutions like DWF Labs and Jump Crypto are already doing this; they are not just market makers, but also "liquidity infrastructure providers."

## VI. Practical Advice for Project Owners and Traders

### Project Team: How to Select and Manage Market Makers

Due diligence checklist :

1. transparency Market makers are required to provide real-time order book data and transaction records.

2. Risk control Clearly define inventory caps and volatility thresholds to prevent market makers from canceling orders during extreme market conditions.

3. Open source first Open-source market-making platforms like OctoBot can avoid "black box operations".

4. Multiple exchanges covered Ensure market makers provide liquidity on at least 5-10 major exchanges.

5. Performance indicators Set specific KPIs, such as average spread, order book depth, and average daily trading volume.

Pricing Negotiation Strategies :

- Avoid "token payments": Using tokens to pay service fees can incentivize market makers to sell off their holdings.

- Performance-based incentives: 50% of expenses are linked to liquidity metrics; if performance is poor, no money is paid.

- Tiered cooperation: Sign a 3-month trial period first, and then sign a long-term contract if you are satisfied.

### Traders: How to Utilize Market Maker Behavioral Patterns

Identifying True Liquidity :

- Observe the order book depth: The order volume of a real market maker will increase with the price distance.

- Test order cancellation speed: Place a large order close to the market price and see if the market maker cancels it immediately.

- Cross-exchange price comparison: If the price difference on one exchange is significantly larger than that on other exchanges, there may be artificial liquidity.

Exploiting the weaknesses of market makers :

- Inventory Imbalance When the market is in a one-sided trend, market makers are forced to hold large amounts of inventory. At this time, they will be eager to close their positions, and can place orders at the opposite price to "pick up bargains".

- Volatility surge Market makers may widen spreads or temporarily cancel orders, causing a sharp drop in market depth. Small orders can lead to significant slippage—this is the perfect opportunity for large traders to manipulate prices.

- Exchange maintenance time When a major exchange is undergoing maintenance, market makers' cross-exchange arbitrage capabilities are impaired, potentially leading to temporary price discrepancies.

## In conclusion: Liquidity has a price, and that price is determined by power

Market makers are not servants of the market, but its masters. They not only provide liquidity, but also define its price. When you see a "deep" order book on an exchange, you are not seeing the natural state of the market, but rather a carefully crafted product of market makers.

As the crypto market matures, market makers will play an even more crucial role. They are the hub connecting project teams, exchanges, and traders; they are the implementers of price discovery mechanisms; and they are also potential perpetrators of market manipulation. Understanding the operating logic of market makers will not only help you become a better trader, but also allow you to see the true nature of the power structure in the crypto market.

Liquidity is never free. Behind every instant trade lies the risk and cost borne by the market maker. At the same time, behind every price fluctuation may lie a carefully designed trap by the market maker. In this invisible empire, only those who truly understand the rules of the game can avoid being exploited and even have the opportunity to share in the profits of this multi-billion dollar market.
