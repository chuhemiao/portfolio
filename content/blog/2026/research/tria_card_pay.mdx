## Executive Summary

Tria represents a paradigm shift in crypto UX through genuine chain abstraction, delivering a self-custodial neobank that processes $20M+ in volume with 300,000+ users in its first three months. Built on BestPath AVS—an EigenLayer-powered intent marketplace—Tria eliminates bridges, gas tokens, and chain-switching while maintaining full user custody via Threshold Signature Schemes. The protocol demonstrates exceptional early traction (13x faster growth than EtherFi's card) and sustainable revenue generation ($1.2M early revenue) through swap spreads, interchange fees, and yield products. While dependency on the unproven AVS model introduces execution risk, Tria's technical architecture, team pedigree, and market positioning warrant serious institutional consideration for both investment and integration opportunities.

## 1. Project Overview

## 2. System Architecture & Chain Abstraction Design

### BestPath AVS: The Intent Marketplace Core

BestPath operates as an EigenLayer Actively Validated Service that creates a permissionless marketplace for cross-chain intent execution. The architecture employs a novel three-tier system:

| Layer        | Component    | Function                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Coordination | Unchained L2 | Arbitrum Orbit + MoveVM chain for global state coordination   |
| Execution    | BestPath AVS | Intent marketplace with Pathfinders, Simulators, Challengers  |
| Security     | TSS Network  | Threshold Signature Scheme via Lit Protocol with SEV hardware |

Pathfinder Mechanism: Solver entities compete in micro-markets to propose optimal execution routes across EVM, SVM, Cosmos, and Move-based chains. Routes are ranked in real-time by cost, speed, and reliability, with Pathfinders compensated based on verifiable execution efficiency (Pareto-optimal incentivization). [Tria Documentation](https://docs.tria.so/bestpath)

Simulator Validation: Independent simulator pairs verify Pathfinder proposals in near-real-time, creating a trust-minimized execution environment. Challengers monitor for malicious behavior with slashing mechanisms for dishonest participants.

Technical Differentiation: Unlike traditional bridges that create wrapped assets or require manual chain switching, BestPath enables direct asset utilization across chains without abstraction layers. The system uses TSS-based execution so users never touch bridges, gas, or token approvals while maintaining full self-custody.

### Architecture Comparison

| Approach            | Trust Assumptions           | User Experience    | Capital Efficiency          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Traditional Bridges | Bridge security + liquidity | Multi-step, manual | Low (wrapped assets)        |
| Intent Systems      | Solver reputation           | Declarative        | Medium (solver competition) |
| Tria BestPath       | AVS security + TSS          | Single-click       | High (direct asset use)     |

## 3. Self-Custody, Asset Model & Financial Primitives

### Custody Implementation

True Self-Custody via Threshold Signature Schemes: Tria implements TSS through Lit Protocol's network, utilizing Asynchronous Decentralized Key Generation (ADKG) where no single node ever possesses or reconstructs an entire private key. This surpasses conventional Multi-Party Computation (MPC) where key reconstruction occurs during creation and signing. [Tria Documentation](https://docs.tria.so/network-construct)

Hardware-Level Security: AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) provides additional protection, ensuring node operators never access key shares directly nor the computation processed inside each node.

Asset Model: Users maintain assets in their native chains without wrapping or bridging. When spending BTC on a Visa card, BestPath routes the transaction through optimal liquidity venues without creating synthetic representations or intermediate tokens.

### Trust Assumption Analysis

| Risk Factor    | Tria Implementation  | Comparative Risk                         |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Key Custody    | TSS with ADKG + SEV  | Superior to MPC and custodial solutions  |
| Bridge Risk    | No bridges used      | Eliminates bridge exploit surface        |
| AVS Security   | EigenLayer restaking | New security model requiring validation  |
| Execution Risk | Multi-path fallback  | Superior to single-solver intent systems |

## 4. Spend, Trade & Earn Modules

### Spend Module: Crypto-Native Banking

Tria Card Implementation: Visa-powered card operating in 150+ countries with 0% fees from Tria (users pay only network interchange). The system hit $1M daily spend in November 2025, demonstrating real-world utility beyond speculative crypto use cases. [Crypto.news](https://crypto.news/tria-neobank-redefine-onchain-finance/)

Settlement Flow:

1. User initiates payment with any of 1,000+ supported assets
2. BestPath computes optimal cross-chain execution path
3. Pathfinders compete to fulfill the intent
4. Settlement occurs through traditional Visa rails
5. User maintains self-custody throughout process

Key Insight: Japanese users particularly value transaction history exports for record-keeping and reconciliation, indicating adoption beyond crypto-natives to traditional finance users with compliance needs. [ChainCatcher](https://www.chaincatcher.com/en/article/2235648)

### Trade Module: AI-Optimized Execution

Cross-Chain Swaps: BestPath's AI routing evaluates liquidity depth, price impact, and execution latency across all connected virtual machines. The system supports perpetual futures trading with cross-margin capabilities using assets from any chain.

Execution Quality: Pathfinders specialize in different execution strategies (fast finality, low slippage, privacy-preserving), creating a competitive marketplace that theoretically drives execution quality toward optimal efficiency.

### Earn Module: Gasless Staking

Cross-Chain Yield Generation: Users can stake assets from any supported chain without managing gas fees or chain-specific staking interfaces. BestPath automatically routes to optimal yield opportunities based on risk-adjusted returns.

Risk Management: The system incorporates validator diversification and slashing protection mechanisms, though specific implementation details remain proprietary.

## 5. Protocol Economics & Incentive Structure

### Revenue Model

Sustainable Multi-Source Revenue: Despite 0% card fees, Tria generates revenue through:

| Stream         | Source                          | Estimated Contribution |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Swap Fees      | Spreads on AI-optimized routing | ~40-50% of revenue     |
| Interchange    | Card network revenue sharing    | ~30-40% of revenue     |
| Yield Products | Spread on staking yields        | ~10-20% of revenue     |

Early revenue reached $1.2M during beta, indicating strong unit economics and scalability. The business model aligns with volume growth rather than rent-seeking behavior.

### Value Accrual

Application Layer Capture: Currently, value accrues primarily at the Tria application layer rather than the BestPath infrastructure layer. However, the architecture suggests potential for:

1. AVS Fee Model: BestPath could implement transaction fees for routing services
2. Token Utility: Potential governance and fee discount token (no current plans)
3. Enterprise Licensing: SDK licensing for developers using Mazerunner/Inception

Scalability Assessment: The revenue model appears highly scalable with marginal cost approaching zero for additional users. The main constraints are regulatory compliance costs and liquidity provisioning for less liquid cross-chain routes.

## 6. Governance, Security & Risk Analysis

### Governance Structure

Current Centralization: Tria maintains operational control over BestPath parameters, simulator eligibility, and ecosystem partnerships. The team has not disclosed decentralization roadmap details, representing a key dependency risk.

Upgrade Mechanisms: Unchained L2 likely serves as a governance coordination layer, but specific upgrade mechanisms and community participation structures remain undefined.

### Risk Surface Analysis

Technical Risks:

- AVS Security: BestPath's security depends on EigenLayer's novel restaking model, which lacks long-term battle testing
- TSS Implementation: While theoretically sound, complex TSS implementations present attack surfaces
- Cross-Chain Execution: Synchronization failures between heterogeneous chains could lead to settlement issues

Financial Risks:

- Liquidity Fragmentation: Optimal routing requires deep liquidity across all connected chains
- Regulatory Uncertainty: Operating in 150+ countries creates complex compliance overhead
- Competition: Traditional finance incumbents and well-funded crypto competitors emerging

Comparative Risk Assessment:

| Protocol Type      | Custody Risk | Technical Risk   | Regulatory Risk |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Custodial Neobanks | High         | Low-Medium       | High            |
| DeFi Aggregators   | Low          | Medium-High      | Medium          |
| Tria               | Low          | High (novel AVS) | Medium-High     |
