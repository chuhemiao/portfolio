## 2. Product & Technical Stack

### Core Protocol Components

zkML Architecture for Off-Chain Inference Verification

The protocol implements a two-stage verification pipeline separating compute from proof validation:

Off-Chain Layer:

- Inference providers compute model evaluations and generate zero-knowledge proofs attesting to committed model usage on specified inputs
- Model weights and internal activations remain cryptographically hidden during computation
- Proof generation utilizes the Expander backend (GKR/sum-check protocol) with quantized ONNX model compilation via ECC to arithmetic circuits

On-Chain Layer:

- Verifiers and smart contracts validate proof integrity against model commitment hashes and input/output pairs
- Confirmation of correct computation occurs without revealing model internals or sensitive data
- Cross-chain interoperability enables seamless verification across multiple networks

DSperse Framework: Proprietary selective "slicing" mechanism for model sub-computations:

- Targets critical paths and decision points in large language models (LLMs) for focused proof generation
- Aggregates proofs for computational efficiency while maintaining security guarantees
- Distributed architecture scales verification across nodes, reducing latency and memory requirements versus full-model zkML approaches

### Omron Marketplace Architecture

Bittensor Subnet-2 (Omron): Decentralized marketplace for zkML proof generation and verification

| Component           | Role                          | Mechanism                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Validators          | Proof request submission      | Submit inference verification tasks to marketplace                             |
| Miners/Providers    | Competitive proof generation  | Race to generate proofs for inference slices, optimizing speed and correctness |
| Verifiers           | On-chain/off-chain validation | Check proof validity and reward efficient provers                              |
| Incentive Structure | Economic optimization         | Bittensor TAO rewards favor fast, accurate proofs; Yuma consensus for scoring  |

Performance Metrics:

- Subnet-2 optimizations reduced median proving latency from 15 seconds to 5 seconds through competitive incentive design
- Processing capacity demonstrated at 300 million proofs in January 2026 stress-testing
- Proving-system agnostic architecture supports EZKL, Circom/Groth16, and other backends

### Privacy Model & Trust Assumptions

Privacy Guarantees:

| Element              | Privacy Mechanism                      | Use Case                                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model Weights        | Cryptographically hidden via zk-proofs | Protect intellectual property while proving model usage |
| Internal Activations | Never exposed during computation       | Prevent reverse-engineering of model architecture       |
| User Inputs/Data     | Remain private to user                 | Enable compliance verification without data disclosure  |

Threat Model:

- Prevention of Model Substitution: Cryptographic commitment prevents audit vs. production model mismatches
- Computation Integrity: Eliminates trust requirements for inference providers through mathematical guarantees
- Verifier Assumptions: Assumes honest verifier behavior; utilizes Fiat-Shamir heuristic for non-interactive proof conversion
- Trust Boundaries: No reliance on secure hardware (TEEs) or reputation systems; purely cryptographic security

Proof Types:

1. Model-Owner Proofs: Demonstrate that a committed model (via hash) produced specific outputs without exposing proprietary weights
2. User Proofs: Verify that private data satisfies model-defined properties (e.g., eligibility criteria) without revealing underlying information

### Storage & Compute Integrations

Arweave Partnership (announced June 18, 2025):

- Proof Publishing System stores ZK-proofs, input attestations, and timestamps on Arweave's permanent storage network
- Each proof receives transaction ID (TX-ID) enabling re-verification via 300+ ar.io gateways
- Provides immutable audit trail for compliance and long-term verification requirements

Bittensor Integration:

- Subnet-2 operates as largest decentralized zkML proving cluster with netuid 2 (mainnet) and netuid 118 (testnet)
- Supports miner/validator infrastructure with proving-system agnostic design
- Processes Bittensor subnet outputs with cryptographic proof attestation
- Integration enables cross-subnet verification for data and compute tasks

Additional Ecosystem Integrations:

## Summary Verdict

Does Inference Labs represent a credible foundation for verifiable, privacy-preserving AI inference as a core primitive in the Web3 stack?

Yes, with qualifications. Inference Labs demonstrates exceptional technical execution with its DSperse modular zkML architecture and production-ready Bittensor Subnet-2 proving cluster (validated by 300M proof stress-test), addressing genuine trust gaps in autonomous agent economies through cryptographic verification superior to TEE or reputation-based alternatives. The protocol's strategic positioning as specialized zkML middleware for high-stakes applications (DeFi risk models, AI governance, regulated deployments) creates defensible moat via network effects and first-mover advantage in operational proving infrastructure. However, credibility as foundational Web3 primitive remains contingent on resolving two critical uncertainties: (1) demonstration of sustainable token economics post-TGE that align stakeholder incentives and capture value from growing proof demand, and (2) achieving cost-competitiveness breakthroughs (via Cysic hardware acceleration and continued algorithmic optimization) that narrow the 3-10x performance gap versus centralized AI inference to economically viable margins for mass adoption. With tier-1 backing, sophisticated technical architecture, and clear product-market fit in emerging autonomous system verticals, Inference Labs represents the most credible zkML infrastructure bet in current Web3 AI landscape, warranting close monitoring through token launch and mainnet scaling phase for validation of long-term foundational status.
