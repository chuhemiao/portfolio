## Executive Summary

MegaETH represents a fundamental architectural breakthrough in EVM execution performance, achieving 100k+ TPS and 10ms block times through specialized node architecture and novel state management via the SALT database. The protocol successfully addresses the historical I/O bottleneck that has constrained EVM chains, positioning itself as the first credible "real-time blockchain" for latency-sensitive applications like on-chain gaming and high-frequency trading. Backed by Vitalik Buterin and Dragonfly Capital with $20M seed funding, MegaETH has demonstrated 35k TPS in production stress tests processing 11B transactions. However, the project faces significant decentralization challenges with current single-sequencer operation and partially opaque tokenomics involving 53% of supply tied to undisclosed KPI milestones. At $2B FDV pre-market, MegaETH offers compelling technical differentiation but requires careful monitoring of its decentralization roadmap and economic transparency.

## 2. System Architecture: Specialized Nodes & State Management

### Node Specialization Model

MegaETH employs a radical departure from traditional blockchain architecture through specialized node types with dramatically different hardware requirements:

| Node Type           | Hardware Requirements         | Role                                   | Decentralization Impact                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Sequencer           | 100+ cores, 1-4TB RAM, 10Gbps | Block production & execution           | Data-center only (centralized)         |
| Full Node           | 16-core, 64GB RAM             | Trustless validation via re-execution  | Enthusiast-grade (decentralizable)     |
| Stateless Validator | Consumer laptop               | Lightweight verification via witnesses | Mass-market accessible (decentralized) |
| Replica Node        | Variable                      | Read-only query processing             | Infrastructure providers               |

This specialization enables the sequencer to achieve unprecedented performance while maintaining verification accessibility. The stateless validator model is particularly innovative, allowing validators to verify blocks without storing state by using cryptographic witnesses provided by the sequencer.

### SALT Database: Solving the I/O Bottleneck

The SALT (Small Authentication Large Trie) database represents MegaETH's core technical innovation, addressing the fundamental I/O bottleneck that has limited EVM performance:

- 100% In-RAM State Trees: Entire authentication structure resides in RAM, eliminating disk I/O delays
- Performance Independence: Throughput remains constant regardless of state size (millions vs billions of keys)
- Parallelizable Updates: CPU-bound design scales linearly with additional cores
- Vector Commitments: Replaces Merkle Patricia Tries with more efficient cryptographic structures

In traditional Ethereum, state root updates consume up to 10x more time than transaction execution itself. SALT reduces this overhead to near-zero, enabling the sequencer to focus on execution rather than I/O wait states. [ENDGAME: SALT Breakthrough](https://www.megaeth.com/blog-news/endgame-how-salt-breaks-the-bottleneck-thats-been-strangling-blockchains)

### Execution Model: Mini-Blocks & Parallelization

MegaETH utilizes a dual-block architecture to balance performance with compatibility:

- Mini-Blocks: 10ms intervals with lightweight metadata for real-time execution
- EVM Blocks: 1-second intervals with full metadata for ecosystem compatibility
- Execute-Then-Order: Parallel transaction processing before final ordering
- No Gas Limits: Removal of computational constraints for applications

The mini-block implementation provides the same rollback guarantees as conventional blocks, making them first-class citizens in the security model rather than optimistic pre-confirmations. [ENDGAME: 10ms Blocks](https://www.megaeth.com/blog-news/endgame-how-weve-achieved-10ms-blocks)

## 3. Technical Comparison: MegaETH vs. Monad Parallel EVM

| Architecture Aspect       | MegaETH                              | Monad                          | Implications                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Primary Bottleneck Solved | I/O (Disk Access)                    | Compute (Parallel Execution)   | Different fundamental constraints          |
| State Management          | SALT (In-RAM Vector Commitments)     | MonadDB (Optimized Read/Write) | MegaETH eliminates I/O, Monad optimizes it |
| Node Architecture         | Specialized (Sequencer vs Validator) | Homogeneous (All Full Nodes)   | MegaETH enables higher peak performance    |
| Consensus & Execution     | Separated (EigenDA + Ethereum)       | Integrated (Monad L1)          | Different security models                  |
| Block Time                | 10ms (mini-blocks)                   | 1s                             | MegaETH better for real-time apps          |
| Time to Finality          | ~12 minutes (Ethereum checkpoint)    | Instant (L1 finality)          | Monad better for fast finality             |

Key Differentiation: MegaETH's specialization allows it to push performance further than homogeneous architectures, but requires trusting the sequencer for liveness. Monad maintains tighter integration between consensus and execution but faces traditional scalability constraints.

## 4. Performance Analysis & Trade-offs

### Demonstrated Capabilities

The January 2026 stress test provided empirical validation of MegaETH's performance claims:

- 35,000 TPS Sustained: Under mixed workload of ETH transfers and AMM swaps
- 11 Billion Transactions: Processed in 7-day test window
- Sub-$0.0002 Fees: Ultra-low transaction costs during stress test
- Real-Time Gaming: Multiple games operated smoothly during peak load

These results significantly exceed current EVM L2 capabilities and approach Solana-class throughput while maintaining EVM compatibility. [99Bitcoins](https://99bitcoins.com/news/altcoins/megaeth-mainnet-lauch-feb-9/)

### Hardware Decentralization Trade-offs

The specialized architecture creates inevitable centralization tensions:

```markdown
Sequencer Centralization: Current single sequencer requires data-center hardware (100+ cores, 1-4TB RAM)
Verification Democratization: Stateless validators enable consumer hardware verification
Progressive Decentralization: Roadmap includes multiple sequencers and permissionless nodes
```

This model mirrors modern cloud infrastructure where heavy computation is centralized but verification is distributed. The security model depends on Ethereum for ultimate settlement and EigenDA for data availability.

## 5. Protocol Economics & Tokenomics

### MEGA Token Distribution

MegaETH employs a structured token distribution with significant allocation to performance-based incentives:

| Allocation       | Percentage     | Details                       | Unlock Schedule                 |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Public Sale      | 5% (500M MEGA) | Auction at $0.0001-$0.0999    | No lock-up for non-US           |
| KPI Rewards      | ~53%           | Tied to TVL/usage milestones  | Gradual unlock based on targets |
| Team & Investors | ~9.5%          | Seed round & foundation       | Vesting periods (undisclosed)   |
| Ecosystem        | ~32.5%         | Grants, partnerships, rewards | Controlled distribution         |

The KPI-based allocation (approximately 5.3B tokens) represents an innovative mechanism that aligns token issuance with actual network utility rather than fixed emission schedules. However, specific performance triggers and vesting details remain undisclosed as of January 2026. [The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/309321/megaeth-tokenomics-kpi-rewards)
